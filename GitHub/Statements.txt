Every clone is really a full backup of all the data

Commit == snapshot

With  Git,  every  time  you  commit,  or  save  the  state  of  yourproject,  Git  basically  takes  a  picture  of  what  all  your  files  look  like  at  that  moment  and  stores  areference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesnâ€™t store the file again,just  a  link  to  the  previous  identical  file  it  has  already  stored.  Git  thinks  about  its  data  more  like  astream of snapshots
